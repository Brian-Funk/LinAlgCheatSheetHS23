# LinAlgCheatSheetHS23

Author: @brfunk
My cheatsheet for the linalg exam. It was inspired by huanndri's cheatsheet. But I added a fair amount of other stuff as well.

Not all the pictures are drawn by my own! I reused them from a cheatsheet, which is not publicly available (but in circulation).

You can find the PDF-file on this website. If you want to add/change things, you can find the TEX-files here. Feel free to add your own stuff as well and change it to your liking.

If you find any mistakes, please let the others know by commenting.

You can find multiple choice and some proofs at the end of the cheatsheet.

Abbreviations:

Def - Definitions
S - Satz
Cor - Corollary
T - Theorem
Ex - Example
Rc - "Recipes" for a certain task
I wish you a great study- and learning-phase and then good luck with the exams. See yaa ~
